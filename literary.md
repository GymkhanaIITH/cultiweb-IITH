        name: Quiz Club
        desc: "More than 200 years after Richard Daly decided to conjure up a new word to win a bet, quizzing remains one of the most popular activities in the world. It provides opportunities to bond with new people, it's a medium to share and learn new information, it gives you a platform to display your vast knowledge, and most importantly, it's just plain fun. We, the Quiz Club of IIT-H, would love nothing more than to share our exciting world with you, and look forward to seeing you during our sessions! We hold an annual Quiz League (LQL), and participate in various quiz competitions elsewhere. Prominently : Nihilanth (Inter IIT-IIM Quiz League), Interrobang (NALSAR’s Quizzing Fest)."

A place for you to express yourself in any form you want, via your sublime writing skills; ranting about your favorite and hated books, movies, TV Series, anything under and beyond the Sun; deliberate and convince people of your or someone else's ideologies via debates, JAMs, turncoats and devil's advocate; embark on an adrenaline-rushed journey to outwit your fellow participants to win the quizzes.
<br>
The only rule is to have fun! And we'll ensure you'll have plenty of it!
<br><br>
All the clubs participate in Literary Fests around the city, the Inter-IIT Cultural Meet, and occasional competitions that pop up!
