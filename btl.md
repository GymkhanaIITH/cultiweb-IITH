The behind the lens club exists to Foster the appreciation and study of film making. The purpose of our club is to give students the opportunity to approach all aspects of film and film making in a serious, meaningful, and in-depth manner. By offering film screenings, speakers, and production opportunities, we strive to expose and educate our student body about the medium we love. If you love watching films, talking about them, making them, or just have interest in connecting with other film lovers, you've come to the right place. <br/>  
Come join us in our weekly meetings - we'd love to have you!
